<ul>
<li>Issue Identification: Conducted a thorough audit of the website to identify all broken code and areas of poor performance.</li>
<li>Debugging and Fixes: Utilized tools such as browser developer tools, log files, and error messages to pinpoint the root causes of the issues. Corrected JavaScript errors, repaired broken links, and resolved CSS conflicts.</li>
<li>Performance Optimization: Enhanced site performance by optimizing code, compressing images, and leveraging browser caching.</li>
<li>Testing and Validation: Conducted extensive testing across different browsers and devices to ensure all issues were resolved and the website functioned smoothly.</li>
<li>Documentation: Provided detailed documentation of all changes made, including before-and-after comparisons and steps for future maintenance.</li><br/>
This project resulted in a significantly improved user experience, with faster load times, fully functional features, and a more robust website overall.
