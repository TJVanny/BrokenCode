Description:<br/>
In this project, I was tasked with diagnosing and fixing broken code on an e-commerce website. The site was experiencing various issues, including slow load times, broken links, and malfunctioning forms. My responsibilities included:

Issue Identification: Conducted a thorough audit of the website to identify all broken code and areas of poor performance.
Debugging and Fixes: Utilized tools such as browser developer tools, log files, and error messages to pinpoint the root causes of the issues. Corrected JavaScript errors, repaired broken links, and resolved CSS conflicts.
Performance Optimization: Enhanced site performance by optimizing code, compressing images, and leveraging browser caching.
Testing and Validation: Conducted extensive testing across different browsers and devices to ensure all issues were resolved and the website functioned smoothly.
Documentation: Provided detailed documentation of all changes made, including before-and-after comparisons and steps for future maintenance.
This project resulted in a significantly improved user experience, with faster load times, fully functional features, and a more robust website overall.
